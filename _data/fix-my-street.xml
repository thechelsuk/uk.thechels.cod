<title>Builders’ waste in front of the garage block, on the highway and pavement/service strip, restricting access to garages and communal parking area. Periodically waste is partially removed but never completely, and has been an issue since the first full week of September this year. Reporting it now as wet and windy conditions over the past few days have resulted in several items being blown across the cul de sac and the soil turning into a ‘river’ of mud on the road and inconveniencing other residents. The waste is not covered and at night there are no lights suggesting that this use of the highway is not licensed., 1st December</title>

<title>Road surface deterioration dangerous to cyclists, 1st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8487073</link>
<description>The nearside of the road cycling down Harp Hill is deteriorated with multiple potholes and surface defects. This is approached on a bike at speed and is dangerous to cyclists. If you hit the uneven surface on a bike you risk losing control. If you avoid the surface problems you are pushed out into the middle of the road with fast moving traffic. Please could you resurface this piece of road in one even continuous patch. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8487073.0.jpeg?2fe744e1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harp Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8487073&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
