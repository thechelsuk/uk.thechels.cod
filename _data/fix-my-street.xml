<title>Squirrels causing damage to roof tiles, 25th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8999722</link>
<description>The oak tree on the public pathway outside my mother&amp;#39;s house at 29 Howell Road GL51 0EE has numerous branches overhanging into her front garden and now within feet of my mother&amp;#39;s property. My mother has just paid £1700 to a roofer to repair a large hole in her roof where roof tiles have been dislodged and the felt has been chewed through. The roofer stated it was damage caused by squirrels inhabiting the tree and using the branches to jump onto the roof of the house. There was evidence squirrels had been nestling in the loft insulation and the roofer advised that although they have repaired the damage she needed to report the tree to get the branches cut back to reduce the risk of it happening again. There is also the cost of my mother already paying a Gardner to pick all the debris from broken branches, acorns, leaves and make good damage caused by the squirrels. I&amp;#39;m also concerned with the size of some branches, one could break and cause my mother serious harm if it fell on her when she&amp;#39;s in her front garden.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8999722.0.jpeg?5cb9152b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 29, Howell Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8999722&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The missing broken fence and large trees still remain and no one attends to the green area on Keriston Avenue, 25th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8998912</link>
<description>Thank you for attending to the overhanging trees along this footpath on the A40 side but unfortunately there is still the issue of the trees overhanging gardens, and dangerously against private fencing. There is also the issue of the broken fencing previously reported and also the lack of maintenance and care on the green area that backs onto this footpath that is used as a quick cut through bringing mud and dog faeces onto Keriston Avenue. Can both of these issues be attended too as a matter of urgency.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Keriston Avenue, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8998912&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>I do not think the sequencing has been correctly reset following the reopening of the A40.Traffic coming in is being held incorrectly which is backing up past Greville house. Those is the know are strarting to reuse the East End Rat run ,which frankly we residents have had enought of! Could you please investigate and rectify before another Artic gets stuck by the Merryfellow Inn? Thanks, 25th February</title>
