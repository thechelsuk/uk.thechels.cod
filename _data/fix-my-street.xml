<title>Damage caused by articulated lorry, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473664</link>
<description>At the bottom of the hill where Syreford Road meets Bees Lane, next to Honeystones GL54 4HW. An articulated lorry initially tried to leave the village via Bees Lane. Realising he couldn&amp;#39;t cross the ford, tried to reverse back up the steep hill adjact to Honeystones. He wrecked the verges and knocked down the 30 speed limit sign attempting to do so. Then he tried to turn right and damaged private property attempting to negotiate the tight bend. We need an &amp;quot;UNSUITABLE FOR HGV&amp;quot; sign on the crossroads next to the Reading Room because this is a recurrent problem where HGVs attempt to use the village roads as a shortcut between the A436 and the A40. Pleas would you reinstate the 30 limit sign and add an &amp;quot;UNSUITABLE FOR HGV&amp;quot; sign at this point. Residents are fed up with damage caused to their property by oversized vehicles attempting to pass through the village this way.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8473664.0.jpeg?88f6d6a0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shipton, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473664&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Glebe Road Prestbury roadworks and flooding repairs., 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473253</link>
<description>Glebe Road Prestbury roadworks and flooding repairs have done immense damage to the road, the kerbs and the verges. The workmen have been intermittent in attendance and leave the road in a terrible state, I cannot walk around the green without slipping on the piles of mud and the mess that has been created. It is not accepatable and none of the residents is clear about what has been achieved or whether the green, the verges and the kerbs will be put in a good state once finished. Nobody clears up at the end of each day and in fact no staff have turned up today the 27th November 2025. Its not looking good.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 8, Glebe Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473253&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472786</link>
<description>&amp;#10;We have had a structural engineer out to our house to look at cracking in the internal and external walls. It is the view of the engineer that there is some shifting of foundations, due to the clay on which these houses are built, and the dry summer we have had. However, he also said the large tree outside our property will be contributing to the dryness as the roots will be sucking up the moisture in the ground. He recommended that the tree be attended to; trimming or crowning it would reduce its water requirements and help our situation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I believe, as the tree is in the pavement, so to speak, it falls to Highways to help us out, if at all possible?&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472786&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
