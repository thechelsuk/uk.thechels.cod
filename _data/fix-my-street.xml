<title>Missing metal cover on drainage deep and wide without any indication of the issue on road, 17th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8706346</link>
<description>Outside local convince store I was coming back on bicycle and drive in to the hazard fall off the bike and broke my wrist also luckily car on road stop to let me go fist on the front of me so if we have to face each other probably I would end up under they wheel as when I realised I am falling off the bike car was stopping&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have now broken wrist and awaiting trauma orthopaedic appointment at Gloucester royal hospital to check if dislocated bit is needed to be undergoing surgery or if locate back to the place I was told at Cheltenham hospital&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rewrite text for me as official report to report issue on public road&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here’s a professional rewrite of your incident suitable for an official report on a public road hazard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;***&amp;#10;&amp;#10;**Incident Report: Bicycle Accident Due to Road Hazard**&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Wednesday late evening while cycling from work near local convenience store, I encountered a road hazard which caused me to lose control of my bicycle and fall. As a result of the fall, I sustained a broken wrist. Following the incident, at 3 am I couldn&amp;#39;t handle pain in wrist and decided to go to Cheltenham Hospital, where an initial assessment confirmed a wrist fracture. I have since been referred to the Trauma and Orthopaedic Department at Gloucester Royal Hospital for further assessment to determine whether surgery is required to realign the bone. I am submitting this report to notify the relevant authority of the hazardous condition on the public road which directly caused this incident, and to request an urgent inspection and remedial action to prevent similar accident.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8706346.0.jpeg?d0920447&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): St Paul&#39;s Road, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8706346&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No Priority Ever Given to Green Arrow, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705573</link>
<description>Since the new lights have gone in at Pirton Lane there is very rarely a green right turn arrow coming from Elmbridge Court. This is more important now or Parton Road closure (much better than 5 way lights!) as there are a lot more left turners meaning that the right turners often at peak times blocking the whole CRE back to Heathdean Road&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705573&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Sunken drainage grid at passing place on Dog Lane, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8704258</link>
<description>There is a passing place on Dog Lane just below Dark Lane. Unwitting drivers pull into this to allow cars to pass and get stuck in the deep hole created by this sunken drain cover. Last week I witnessed a van driver having the panel above his wheel ripped off as he tried to extricate himself from this hole. This time it was just a panel but it could be more serious. The cover needs to be raised to road level or this part of the road bollarded in some form to avoid this safety issue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8704258.0.jpeg?df7eb80b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dog Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8704258&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Contrary to report saying this has been fixed, the push button for the pedestrian crossing across Cheltenham Road still switches off before the pedestrian light turns green so traffic doesn’t stop. You have to keep button pressed so it doesn’t switch off.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Nine Elms Road, Elmbridge, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8704156&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pothole alongside Willowbank on Dog Lane, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8704085</link>
<description>This pothole is adjacent to a recent repair by yourselves outside Willowbank on Dog Lane. Given the poor state of the lane in general it is disappointing to see persistent patching leaving other adjacent areas that will inevitably cause a problem within a matter of weeks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8704085.0.jpeg?6a9165ba&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dog Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8704085&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8704013</link>
<description>On this corner the road surface has dropped and the problem is now exacerbated by the pot hole. This is just below an area used to pull in to let vehicles pass and between the panelled fence area of The Kneelings field and the field to The Uplands.

It is just past the cottage seen on the right hand side and before the entrance to Mill Croft on the left hand side - look carefully as it consists of Black Sacks and some other rubbish which were a bit difficult to see.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can it be cleared up as soon as possible&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Mill Lane, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8703985&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
