<title>Neighbours Visitors parking over driveway, 2nd December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8493838</link>
<description>My neighbours visitors continually park across my driveway making it very difficult to enter or exit my driveway. I am just about to buy my third child a car which means we have 5 cars which we park on the driveway. I wouldn’t like there to be any accidents due to the nature of the parking directly opposite our driveway.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8493838.0.jpeg?580d84e9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pansy Gardens, Wheatpieces, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8493838&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Multiple potholes across the carriageway width dangerous to cyclists, 2nd December</title>

<description>There are multiple patched potholes across the width of the carriageway that are forming additional potholes. These are dangerous to cyclists who approach this piece of road at speed due to the downhill approach. It is difficult to pick a safe route through these defects and risk losing control and a possible serious accident. Please, please, please can repaired with a continuous patch as part of the upcoming repairs to Harp Hill.

<title>Multiple potholes across the carriageway width dangerous to cyclists, 2nd December</title>

<description>There are multiple patched potholes across the width of the carriageway with additional potholes forming. This is approached at speed on a bike and is dangerous to cyclists. I find it difficult to pick a safe route through and am forced wider into the road to the annoyance of car drivers. There is a risk of a cyclist losing control and crashing at speed. Please, please, please can you ensure that this defect is fixed as part of the upcoming roadworks on Harp Hill.

<title>Multiple potholes dangerous to cyclists, 2nd December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8492845</link>
<description>This area has multiple potholes across the whole carriageway width that are approached at speed on a bike as this is a fast downhill piece of road. It is extremely difficult to cycle over this piece of road safely and I frequently experience loss of control, but thankfully haven&amp;#39;t crashed here. This poor road surface extends for several tens of meters on the near side of the road forcing cyclists out into the road to the annoyance of car drivers. Harp Hill is one of the primary minor roads back into Cheltenham, returning from a Cotswold cycle ride and I find the state of this road especially dangerous due to the multiple defects along the entire length. Please, please, please can you ensure that these defects are resolved un your upcoming work. Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8492845.0.jpeg?c201520c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harp Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8492845&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Multiple potholes dangerous to cyclists, 2nd December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8492756</link>
<description>The area of road shown in the photo is deteriorating in multiple places and forming potholes. There is a narrow resurfaced area. This is downhill and when approaching on a bike this can be at speed. The defects on the road are such that it is possible to lose control of your bike and the possible consequence of a serious accident. Please, please, please can you ensure that this is resurfaced in your upcoming planned work. Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8492756.0.jpeg?1f82ec97&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harp Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8492756&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Filter not working, 2nd December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8492581</link>
<description>Every night I get stuck at the bottom of the golden valley bypass and it takes 39minute+ to get from there to the greyhound pub. The reason, when the new lights were installed no one thought it would be a good idea to put a filter on these lights for people turning right. This means on each light sequence multiple times no one is able to turn, this has a knock on effect on the Elmbridge court roundabout as the cars back up all the way to the bypass, I could walk this in 3 minutes, yet in the car after 10hrs at work this can take between 30-40 minutes at 5:45-6:15 pm. Absolutely ridiculous oversight. This needs sorting as it is causing a dangerous situation with cars queuing on the Elmbridge court roundabout&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Nine Elms Road, Elmbridge, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8492581&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
