<title>Builders’ waste in front of the garage block, on the highway and pavement/service strip, restricting access to garages and communal parking area. Periodically waste is partially removed but never completely, and has been an issue since the first full week of September this year. Reporting it now as wet and windy conditions over the past few days have resulted in several items being blown across the cul de sac and the soil turning into a ‘river’ of mud on the road and inconveniencing other residents. The waste is not covered and at night there are no lights suggesting that this use of the highway is not licensed., 1st December</title>
