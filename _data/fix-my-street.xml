<title>Road closed for months causing chaos, 14th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8684280</link>
<description>This road has been closed for months and I&amp;#39;m the icy conditions is causing chaos getting into cleeve because you can&amp;#39;t use Gambles Lane in icy conditions and there are more roadworks on Southam lane causing chaos trying to get down Kayte Lane. I live in Winchcombe so either have to go that way or Gotherington and that road is currently closed too. If you look at a map of cleeve/gotherington you will see all the roadworks and you are now planning on closing gambles Lane in the coming weeks making it almost impossible to get into cleeve which I have to do daily&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Southam Lane, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8684280&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Poor road surface, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682585</link>
<description>The entirety of the road on Victoria Place is in a sorry state. It probably needs resurfacing as it is extremely dangerous in its current state. I see this issue has been reported before, however, it hasn&amp;#39;t yet been addressed and the situation is worsening throughout the winter. Throughout the last couple of months I have seen at least two people burst their bike tyres on the surface. Fortunately nobody was hurt. Please address this. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 17, Victoria Place, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682585&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The entire street beyond terrible state of the road, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682158</link>
<description>Almost the entire street, but particularly between number 45 - 53 Keynsham Street, have terrible terrible road situation which is constantly causing huge damage to cars and I am concerned about a sink hole too. The damage has been caused in large part by Severn Trent digging up the street so many times to fix water issues and never making the street smooth again. It is shockingly bad.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 47, Keynsham Street, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682158&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
