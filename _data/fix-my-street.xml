<title>Parking on old Cheltenham Road. Why have the double yellow lines not been repainted?, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8697832</link>
<description>Car parking during school drop / pick up is unsafe. Parking on both sides of old Cheltenham Road near the Longlevens school walk way which comes out onto old Cheltenham Road. They park right up to the junction and over driveways. This issues becoming worse and worse with near misses of vehicles turning the corner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prior to the green cycle path being completed there were double yellow lines on old Cheltenham Road. These have not been reinstated, why? When you search online for the double yellow lines it still shows as they are there. They are not and this is unsafe. Unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists crossing the road as well as other motorists turning the corner from Cheltenham Road into old Cheltenham Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Old Cheltenham Road, Longlevens, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8697832&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pedestrian buttons not working for green man to come on, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8697808</link>
<description>Cheltenham Road / old Cheltenham Road pedestrian crossing. Once you press the button to use the pedestrian crossing, it randomly turns off without showing the green man. We use this crossing daily and it happens every time. Sometimes I have to press the button 5 times before the green man shows which can take some time. Danergous when trying to teach young children how to cross the road properly.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Old Cheltenham Road, Longlevens, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8697808&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Difficulty to use path due to cars parked and bins and rubbish left out permanently, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8696355</link>
<description>This stretch of path is difficult to pass with a mobility scooter and prams due to vehicles parked on the pavement and recycling and rubbish (bin and suitcase) and bins permanently stored on the verge belonging to 106 Welch Road. The recycling lids and contents often blow over the path. This has been ongoing for several months and has been previously reported. Residents should store their bins and recycling within their property boundary. This is a very busy pavement used by children going to school and families with young children and pushchairs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8696355.0.jpeg?a1a48718&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 108, Welch Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8696355&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
