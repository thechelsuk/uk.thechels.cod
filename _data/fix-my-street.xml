<title>Entire road is riddled with pot hole, 26th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9001474</link>
<description>From Gloucester road to the National hunt pub. The whole road needs resurfacing. Repairs have been done in the past and they have lasted 24 hours. This is a high traffic road due to connections to the M5. It is quickly becoming dangerous as cars swerve to avoid multiple holes, some being 100mm deep. This has been ongoing for approx 2 months. Do it properly, do it once, saves cost in the long run. Small repairs are not adequate.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 34, Whittington Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9001474&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Squirrels causing damage to roof tiles, 25th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8999722</link>
<description>The oak tree on the public pathway outside my mother&amp;#39;s house at 29 Howell Road GL51 0EE has numerous branches overhanging into her front garden and now within feet of my mother&amp;#39;s property. My mother has just paid £1700 to a roofer to repair a large hole in her roof where roof tiles have been dislodged and the felt has been chewed through. The roofer stated it was damage caused by squirrels inhabiting the tree and using the branches to jump onto the roof of the house. There was evidence squirrels had been nestling in the loft insulation and the roofer advised that although they have repaired the damage she needed to report the tree to get the branches cut back to reduce the risk of it happening again. There is also the cost of my mother already paying a Gardner to pick all the debris from broken branches, acorns, leaves and make good damage caused by the squirrels. I&amp;#39;m also concerned with the size of some branches, one could break and cause my mother serious harm if it fell on her when she&amp;#39;s in her front garden.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8999722.0.jpeg?5cb9152b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 29, Howell Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8999722&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
