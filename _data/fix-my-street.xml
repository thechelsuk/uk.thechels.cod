<title>Road Clsed Sign obstructed, 23rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8453875</link>
<description>The permanent Road Closed flip sign is obstructed by vegetation &amp;amp; a large 4x4 which is parked on the householders driveway. This sign is sited in a poor location and is easily missed by motorists who turn onto the lane. As this is the only warning sign along the lane before vehicles encounter flooding past the Red Lion Inn many miss it only to find out it’s too late when they’re in over 2ft of flood waters. The sign is in desperate need of being repositioned to a site which is more visible to motorists turning onto the lane. On the evening of 17/11/2025 numerous motorists missed seeing this sign &amp;amp; as there was no temporary signs deployed further along the lane at this time at least four ploughed into flood waters over 2ft deep after the river Chelt. Improvements regarding signage &amp;amp; depth of waters are required along the entirety of the lane. How many more motorists will miss the sign &amp;amp; continue along the lane, hit the flood waters before there’s a fatality?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Wainlode Lane, Norton, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8453875&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
