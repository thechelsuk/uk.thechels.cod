<title>2 foot pothole, sent me over the handlebars, 12th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8669635</link>
<description>Just outside 14 Greenhills Road. Thursday night last week I was cycling along the road. It had been raining and the pothole was filled with and covered with water, so I couldn’t see it. On looking at it now it seems to be about 7.5cm deep, and two feet across. The pot hole swallowed the front wheel of my bike, and sent me over the handlebars into the road. In front of a car. It was far enough behind me it stopped in time, so I am only grazed and bruised.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8669635.0.jpeg?69cecd4c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 6, Greenhills Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8669635&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Sunken road, damaging to car wheels, 12th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8669524</link>
<description>Location: By the bus stop on the left when driving towards the A435 from the village (opposite side to the subsidence repaired late last year).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The road surface has sunken again by the bus stop on the left-hand side when travelling towards the A435. Opposite the location of a sunken hole that was repaired at the end of last year. Given the proximity to the previous repair, does this indicate a wider underlying issue rather than an isolated defect. Vehicles driving along the road and busses pulling into and out of the bus stop are already altering their position, which is likely to accelerate deterioration elsewhere and presents a potential safety risk. Please could this area be inspected promptly, and can consideration be given to checking the rest of this road as a preventative measure where repeat subsidence has occurred.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bramble Chase, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8669524&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overflowing public bin at the base of Coopers Hill, near the car park, 12th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8669508</link>
<description>The public dustbin at the base of Coopers Hill, located just off the car park near postcode GL3 4SB (approximately 51.83171° N, 2.15728° W), is overflowing and has not been emptied. Rubbish is spilling out of the bin and is being scattered across the hill and surrounding area, likely due to wind and wildlife. This is causing litter to spread and is impacting the cleanliness of the area. The bin needs to be emptied as soon as possible to prevent further mess and potential environmental issues.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Nuthill, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8669508&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pot holes everywhere, 12th January</title>

<description>Extremely bad road surface, much worse since new houses were built, probably caused by so much construction traffic. Perhaps when new builds are granted, the construction companies should be contributing to road upkeep.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harp Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8669425&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
