<title>Whole road is a disgrace. Littered with potholes., 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8863372</link>
<description>Between the racecourse roundabout and the mini roundabout with Tommy Taylor’s lane. That whole 200m stretch of road needs resurfacing urgently. The road is in an appalling state, littered with unavoidable potholes. There will be accidents on this road as people swerve to avoid them. Please resurface asap.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 26, Swindon Lane, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8863372&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Multiple very deep pot holes on west bound lane., 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8863318</link>
<description>This stretch of road is now horrendously dangerous to drive on. The pot holes are so deep and on either side of the lane that people are driving erratically in order to avoid them. It is supposed to be a 40mph road but you can no longer drive safely at that speed. At night or in the rain it is impossible to see where the pot holes are to avoid them. This road has been patched up for years but now it needs proper resurfacing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hayden Road, Hesters Way, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8863318&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road gulley chamber collapsed, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8863085</link>
<description>Gulley grid has dropped 8” from road level due to collapse of chamber below. This leads to flooding of the carriageway. This problem was first identified as far back as 1998. There is evidence of adjacent previous attempts at tarmac patching which is obviously inappropriate.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8863085.0.jpeg?8fc2d5b0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Manor Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8863085&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pothole 18 inch by 10 inch by at least 6 inch deep, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862838</link>
<description>Location: Heading up Leckhamtom Hill 100 mtrs before Starr Colege turnoff. This pothole was reported on the 18th Jan, was inspected on the 20th and no action was decided even though the report said it caused damage to tyre.(FixMyStreet ref: 8723685) I HAVE JUST HAD MY TYRE DAMAGED on this hole which should have been repaired weeks ago!! I am having a new tyre fitted tomorrow and checks on car. I will be taking action to recover my costs for what was an avoidable action. Please provide Claim Form. The location of this hole means that when any car is on the opposite side of the road you are forced into it. This a very urgent repair request. Tried to report on Emergency line but line very busy!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8862838.0.jpeg?cb987970&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): B4070, Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862838&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large puddle in front of school crossing, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862203</link>
<description>The remedial work to the crossing across Evesham Road has left a long and deep depression immediately in front of the crossing which does not drain. The two drains nearby are too high to drain that area, even when they are not clogged with leaves. This causes a very big puddle which vehicles cannot easily avoid, so children going to school need to stand well back from the road to avoid being splashed. This puts them into the cycle lane. The puddle can last for over a day without rain.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Central Cross Drive, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862203&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The cycle path needs sweeping, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8861878</link>
<description>The cycle path from junction of commerce Road and Cheltenham Road East to Arle court roundabout needs sweeping. There is lots of small bits of gravel, mud (where water collects) and debris from trees all along the path. It’s getting slippery in the wet weather and is particularly hazardous for those using road bikes. Please could it be properly swept.
