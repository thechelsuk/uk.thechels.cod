<title>Dog poo, 3rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8826273</link>
<description>Reported yesterday got an email saying fixed but was not as my son came out of school and stepped in the exact bit that id reported that morning. Very disappointing. In the corner of house number 41 GL33HS on the pavement is dog poo and between numbers 45-47 the pavement by the bushes still there. Further on down that pavement is just lots of mud its disgusting and needs a good clean, its unfair do the kids going into school. The dog poo round this area is diabolical.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dinglewell, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8826273&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Massive potholes all the way down North Road West, 3rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8825983</link>
<description>As usual the repairs were rubbish in North Road West....there are potholes all the way down this road. And the sides of the road is disintegrating day by day. The whole road is just full of holes mainly due to shoddy workmanship in the past. The road needs shutting completely and the whole road needs resurfacing from top to bottom and from side to side.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): North Road West, Golden Valley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8825983&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Sunken chamber cover-outside Hedgerows GL51 6RL, 2nd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8824136</link>
<description>Outside Hedgerows in main carriageway: Your team arrived to carryout this task w/c 26th Jan 2026, But unfortunately they were unable to remove the cast iron cover from the frame. Therefore they laid some temporary tarmac over the sunken cover . This now requires a return visit with the required tools to remove the cover &amp;amp; frame and possibly replace with a new one if the current cover is not repairable. Many Thanks to your team for their effort on the day. Steel inspection/drain cover located in the highway adjacent to Property ‘Hedgerows’ rattles/bangs as traffic drives over. I have a drain in lower floor of my Property ’Windermere’ on the opposite side of the road. when traffic travel over the said chamber cover I get a noise/knocking sound in our property. I can hear this throughout the ground floor and is now causing a nuisance. My tel 07788567901. Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): The Reddings, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8824136&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
