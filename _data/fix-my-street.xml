<description>There are 2 potholes up Brockhampton Lane by GE Aerospace and then another 5 along Brockhampton Lane from Longacre Farm towards to Hamlet of Brockhampton. These potholes were reported back on the 16.1.26 under GCC enquiry 22097311 and only 2 were repaired and these 5 potholes were left to get bigger, and reported again.

<title>Potholes, unacceptable road maintenance, 18th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8950153</link>
<description>The roads in this area are horrendous. Even the roads that have been “repaired” have started to fall apart again. But this, this is just unacceptable! This end of Severn Road has been deteriorating for years, entering and exiting the road is a hazard. No matter how slow you try and go the car rocks and bumps all over the place. We’ve already lost one tyre recently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 67, Severn Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8950153&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Cromwell Road from 17 down to the corner at 11 seems to be rapidly disintegrating. I am baffled as to why you recently came to repair one pothole but did not bother with the rest of them. There are plenty to chose from. They are deep. One is in the middle of the road. Others nearer the pavement and constantly ejecting large stones. Dangerous to people and property. Your repairs never seem to last very long. I have in the last year had 3 tyres destroyed by Gloucestershire potholes (£750+) and I&#39;m a little fed up of it. I suspect the constant and ludicrously heavy lorries from Mira thundering up and down the street at the crack of dawn do not help. They literally shake my house when they go past. Please get this sorted. Now., 18th February</title>
