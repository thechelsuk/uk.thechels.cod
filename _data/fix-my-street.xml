<title>Two Potholes deeper than tennis balls on Gambles Lane, 17th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8942773</link>
<description>W3W mops.user.remission Due to Gambles Lane being used as an unofficial diversion for the closure of New Road the condition is getting worse. As previously stated it is very narrow with few passing places. These two potholes are in the narrowest part of Gambles Lane. This evening we helped yet another vehicle with a punctured tyre who had to use our drive as a place to be rescued by a towing truck. This follows on from our own damaged vehicle (broken suspension, punctured tyre, buckled wheel). Our previous complaint about these potholes has been closed and we have been notified they will be filled within the next 28 days. As these potholes are full of water they are very difficult to gauge their depth. It seems the diversion will be carrying on until at least the end of February so the problems on Gambles need to be rectified now. We are experiencing at least 5 times the normal traffic (delivery vans, builders trucks, heavy lorries etc etc). The residents on Gambles are experiencing drive, wall and property damage which is unsustainable. Please help !!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8942773.0.jpeg?131a3dbc&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gambles Lane, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8942773&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
