<title>Slightly out of view traffic, near miss collision, 18th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8712213</link>
<description>The traffic light by the Audi garage facing towards Smyths toy store. The traffic light here is dangerous for pedestrians. It turns red for cars coming left from the Tewkesbury Road. However, due to the bend in the road and momentum with which cars drive around it, cars don’t notice the red traffic light at the pedestrian crossing. This morning (18 Jan) at 1025, I waited at the pedestrian light to cross, when it was green for me and red for the cars, 5 cars drove through the light and one did not stop when I walked into the road despite me having right of way. This traffic light is positioned dangerously. Please consider changes or else a fatality will inevitably happen&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8712213&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water pouring from public footpath into Bentham Lane, 18th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8711868</link>
<description>For the last few weeks there has been a constant flow of water from the public footpath opposite Smiths Barn on to Bentham Lane which is breaking up the road surface as it flows down into Dog Lane. This is a fairly recent phenomenon and may indicate some changes to the topology of the site known locally as ‘the golf course’.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8711868.0.jpeg?b31e127d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bentham Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8711868&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Constant stream of water pouring down Dog Lane, 18th January</title>

<description>There has been a constant stream of water pouring down Bentham Lane into Dog Lane and then into the drain. The flooding at the junction is a hazard (particularly when it freezes) and is breaking up the road surface.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8711841.0.jpeg?eb8a1f41&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dog Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8711841&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>This is a very poor repair of a pothole. If you study the picture there have been gouges made in the original surface to which the new tarmac should abut. It does not. No decent compaction or edging resulting in rapid deterioration of repair. Tarmac saving and poor effort. The same has happened with a similar repair up the road. Do you not carry out quality control?!, 18th January</title>

<title>Damaged cones littering the verges, 17th January</title>

<description>There are numerous fallen and damaged cones dotted along the stretch from Seven Springs to the Withington turn, with most being from Pegglesworth through to the Kilkenny pub. They are just littering the highway and serving no purpose at all. As there are roadworks being undertaken along this road, it&amp;#39;s an opportunity to remove them.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8710729&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
