<title>Flooding/ Poor road surface, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8738598</link>
<description>Between Gotherington railway bridge and turn off to Dixton.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Even though there has been rain in the last 24 hours, when there hasn’t been this section of road takes ages to drain as there seems to be no drainage. It is a major hazard as cars drive in the middle of the road where theres some surface still visible to avoid the dangerous surface below the water. It really needs looking into asap as there’s going to be an accident sooner or later. The whole Gretton/ Gotherington Road needs resurfacing as there’s multiple issues.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gretton Road, Prescott, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8738598&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large pothole on 70mph road not visible in the dark. Still not fixed, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8737909</link>
<description>Went straight over this dangerous pothole today (not signposted or even marked) causing a puncture and potential damage to my suspension. Came here to report to find out the council has been aware of the issue for over a week and nothing has been done to even make other drivers aware of it? Luckily all that happened to me was hearing a large bang but could’ve easily ended having much worse damage to my car or had I swerved at the speed the road permits, a crash. I will be filing a claim against the council and I suggest that anyone else does too because the fact that it is taking this long to even put white lines around a pothole is absolutely absurd.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tewkesbury Road, Deerhurst, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8737909&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Huge pothole has opened up again. Over 10 people have burst tyres now including hotel guests, staff and village locals. You cannot dodge it as the road is too narrow, and now I myself have burst a tyre today. The water runs over the road when raining and hides the large patch of badly repaired holes so impossible to see and avoid. It’s close to being an emergency now and cannot emphasise enough how bad it has gotten in the last two weeks. Maybe someone needs to drive down there to drive through the hole to see for themselves how bad it is. With the other back roads to cowley being closed for various reasons, this is the only access road to the village. The road is surprisingly busy and needs attention., 21st January</title>
