<title>URGENT Hi there, I am following up the message below which was sent to my Father-in-law, Peter Kingston. He is now too old and frail to deal with such matters, so I am now taking this up. Firslty, I am not aware of there being any formal repsonse to the email below, so no further progress has happened in this very long-standing issue. Secondly, and of more immediate concern is the fact that the pond by the highway adjacent to the entrance to Manor, Mill and Dovecote barns is completely clogged up and has been unable to drain for the last 3 or 4 weeks. This has not happened before and in the past when the pond has flooded, it has usually drained and retuned to normal in a couple of days or so. There is water continuously bubbling up on to the raod from the manhole causing water to cross the road and run along the edge of the verge up towards the Abbey Dressage entrance further up the lane. This has been continuous for aboout 3 or 4 weeks now. This is now causing a severe probelm for two critical reasons: 1. The road is becoming highly dangerous now in the cold weather. We have had 3 or 4 very cold nights in the last couple of weeks, and yesterday, for example, the lane had developed black ice for some distance by virtue of traffic spreading water and then that water refreezing laong the lane. There is ahigh risk of an accident as so many cars drive too fast, and the water overflow (and consequently, ice) is near a bend. 2. Our Sewage Treatment Plant that serves the above three barns and Fiddington Manor is now continuously flooded becasue of the pond water level, and the inability for the pond to drian properly. This is becoming an environmental hazard. The reason these problems exist is because the drainage from the pond to the ditch is blocked (presumably), as evidenced by the water bubbling up from under the manhole cover. We have requested that Highways attend to a lasting solution for years now, with no measures yet taken. The best solution, as proposed by Peter Kingston, is to add a new large drain from the manhole, or near the pond egress direct to the ditch alog the Highway, to enable the pond to drain properly. I have recent photos and videos that demonsrarte the issues, should you wish to see them. I would be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this email as a matter of urgency and communicate and action a proper and lasting solution to the problem. In meantime, we will be holding Highways accountable and responsible for any issues/loss/demage resulting from failure to resolve the two matters above (ice hazard and environmental hazard) unless and until they are finally rectified. We will also be considering taking legal advice if no response or serious proposal is put forward by Highways to us within the next 7 days. Yours sinceelry, Andrew Smith (Fiddington Manor) Good Afternoon, Thank you for your email, I have passed this over to the new highways Representative to look into Many Thanks &amp; Kind regards, Kyle Harrington Highways Customer Service Operative Highways Commissioning Gloucestershire County Council Did you know that you can report highway issues online at www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/fixmystreet or download the app: FixMyStreet For Urgent Enquires Tel: 08000 514 514 Bearland | Block 5 | Gloucester | GL1 2TG From: Peter Kingston &lt;pkekingston@gmail.com&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 7, 2024 1:23 PM To: Highways Customer Service &lt;highways@gloucestershire.gov.uk&gt; Subject: Re[2]: Enquiry 11258847 and suggestion Dear Chris, I am grateful for your attention to the problems we have been facing with the flooding of the pond and consequent backflooding into our STP. I am afraid that the clearance of the roots which I believe was done further down the drain line, adjacent to the old road, has not resolved the problem; the pond has repeatedly flooded and. in spite of our best efforts, has flooded our stp system almost every time, with resultant pollution of the stream. As a direct cost of the recent last time the pond flooded, our stp has broken down. I have been unable to ascertain the cost at present, but it could well be over £12,000.00. You can understand that we find the situation aggravating. I have however come up with a simple solution which would be inexpensive and would, I believe, completely resolve the issue. I attach a plan, obtained I believe from Gloucester Highways. The outflow from the pond passes under an earth bank to empty into a manhole on the east side of the bridleway, which I have marked &quot;M&quot;, where it joins the main road drain. This drain then follows the line of the old road (under trees and roots) and loops back into the road at Manhole &quot;P&quot;, from where it crosses to the southeast side of the roadway and empties into a roadside ditch at &quot;Q&quot;. This ditch on the southeast side (&quot;W&quot;) is deep at &quot;Q&quot;, but shallow higher up at &quot;X&quot;, very close to the manhole &quot;M&quot; (only a very few feet). If the ditch were deepened as necessary back up from &quot;Q&quot; to its beginning at &quot;X&quot; - a relatively simple earthmoving job -- AND a very short road drain were installed linking the manhole &quot;M&quot; directly to &quot;X&quot;, then all water coming down the road, and from the pond, would be diverted into the deepened ditch along the path marked in red. No water would then need to go under the road or among the tree roots but would flow directly to join the existing outflow at &quot;Q&quot;. I believe this would be much easier too in terms of long term maintenance. I wonder if Gloucester Highways could envisage doing this? It would solve a long term problem. Kind regards, Peter Kingston (on behalf of Fiddington Manor Ltd), 4th December</title>

<title>Blocked drain, 4th December</title>

<description>The drain between lampposts 19 and 21 on the Cirencester Road, Cheltenham is still blocked despite the work carried out yesterday. The work only swept the surface and did not clear the drain which needs to be flushed through. The photograph taken this morning after light rain clearly shows that the remedial work has not been effective.
