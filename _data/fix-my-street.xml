<title>Footpath &amp; Cycle Way Obstructed for Weeks, 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474821</link>
<description>Massive open hole blocking entire footpath and half of cycle route, for weeks now with absolutely NO work being done. The &amp;quot;flagship&amp;quot; walkway and cycle route left for weeks on end, with pedestrians having to use extreme caution as they are forced to use the cycle path as a result of there being no pavement, with electric bikes flying along at absurd speeds. Nothing has changed for weeks and it feels that the local highways agency treat the general public with utter contempt. How are contractors allowed to leave gaping holes in a footpath for weeks on end? Why isn&amp;#39;t something being done about this complete disgrace?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8474821.0.jpeg?416a7d1f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474821&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Damage caused by articulated lorry, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473664</link>
<description>At the bottom of the hill where Syreford Road meets Bees Lane, next to Honeystones GL54 4HW. An articulated lorry initially tried to leave the village via Bees Lane. Realising he couldn&amp;#39;t cross the ford, tried to reverse back up the steep hill adjact to Honeystones. He wrecked the verges and knocked down the 30 speed limit sign attempting to do so. Then he tried to turn right and damaged private property attempting to negotiate the tight bend. We need an &amp;quot;UNSUITABLE FOR HGV&amp;quot; sign on the crossroads next to the Reading Room because this is a recurrent problem where HGVs attempt to use the village roads as a shortcut between the A436 and the A40. Pleas would you reinstate the 30 limit sign and add an &amp;quot;UNSUITABLE FOR HGV&amp;quot; sign at this point. Residents are fed up with damage caused to their property by oversized vehicles attempting to pass through the village this way.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8473664.0.jpeg?88f6d6a0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shipton, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473664&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Glebe Road Prestbury roadworks and flooding repairs., 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473253</link>
<description>Glebe Road Prestbury roadworks and flooding repairs have done immense damage to the road, the kerbs and the verges. The workmen have been intermittent in attendance and leave the road in a terrible state, I cannot walk around the green without slipping on the piles of mud and the mess that has been created. It is not accepatable and none of the residents is clear about what has been achieved or whether the green, the verges and the kerbs will be put in a good state once finished. Nobody clears up at the end of each day and in fact no staff have turned up today the 27th November 2025. Its not looking good.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 8, Glebe Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8473253&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
