<title>Poor road surface, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682585</link>
<description>The entirety of the road on Victoria Place is in a sorry state. It probably needs resurfacing as it is extremely dangerous in its current state. I see this issue has been reported before, however, it hasn&amp;#39;t yet been addressed and the situation is worsening throughout the winter. Throughout the last couple of months I have seen at least two people burst their bike tyres on the surface. Fortunately nobody was hurt. Please address this. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 17, Victoria Place, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682585&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The entire street beyond terrible state of the road, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682158</link>
<description>Almost the entire street, but particularly between number 45 - 53 Keynsham Street, have terrible terrible road situation which is constantly causing huge damage to cars and I am concerned about a sink hole too. The damage has been caused in large part by Severn Trent digging up the street so many times to fix water issues and never making the street smooth again. It is shockingly bad.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 47, Keynsham Street, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8682158&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Obstructed Streetlight, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8681730</link>
<description>There are 2 streetlights on our road obstructed by overgrown greenery. One is completely obstructed by a tree with no light reaching the pavement and the other is semi-obstructed by ivy but soon to be entirely obstructed. As you can imagine, the lack of lighting is a concern to nearby residents, and a waste of energy when they are on every night but with no purpose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The streetlights are too obscured to read the column numbers. However, the What3Words location of these 2 streetlights are: - lend.limes.tribe - brave.hurls.pull&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please find attached a photo of one of the streetlights.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8681730.0.jpeg?3d18e99a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 12, Radnor Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8681730&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
