<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472981</link>
<description>The workers have left site in a dangerous condition. It is very difficult to get in and out of our houses with equipment, barriers cones left all around the green. There is copious amounts of mud on the roads and paths which has not been cleared away at any point of the work undertaken. This is a big project and has taken weeks to sort out. All the curbs are in a mess as well as our beloved green . Can someone please come out and access the damage done .&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 17, Glebe Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472981&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472786</link>
<description>&amp;#10;We have had a structural engineer out to our house to look at cracking in the internal and external walls. It is the view of the engineer that there is some shifting of foundations, due to the clay on which these houses are built, and the dry summer we have had. However, he also said the large tree outside our property will be contributing to the dryness as the roots will be sucking up the moisture in the ground. He recommended that the tree be attended to; trimming or crowning it would reduce its water requirements and help our situation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I believe, as the tree is in the pavement, so to speak, it falls to Highways to help us out, if at all possible?&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8472786&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
