<title>Numerous potholes on Horsefair Street between junction of Lyefield Road West and St Mary’s Church., 21st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8966604</link>
<description>Horsefair Street between Lyefield Road West and the intersection by St Mary’s Church is littered with numerous potholes. This stretch of road was not re-surfaced when surrounding roads were a couple of years ago.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The closure of A40 has caused huge increase in traffic on this road and is in dire need of repair. Now that the A40 is back open, there is an opportunity to sort this out. The residents along here have put up with months of inconvenience due to increased traffic and now have a deteriorated road surface that is a danger to cars and people.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 24, Horsefair Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8966604&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
