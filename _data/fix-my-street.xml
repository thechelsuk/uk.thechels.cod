<title>Multiple lights not working, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8849263</link>
<description>I have reported this a couple of months ago. It is very dangerous leaving the A417 onto the slip road as it is very dark. The yellow bollard is not lighting up when driving towards it you could easily crash into it. Why has it not been sorted. The lampposts/lighting are there for a reason.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockworth Interchange, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8849263&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Green or amber traffic light is not working problem, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8847368</link>
<description>I want to draw your attention to an issue we have with regards to the pedestrian crossing outside GCHQ. We have counted several times each cycle and on average the lights were on red for 17 seconds. We hoped that this could be reduced to more like 10-12 seconds. For a number of months, we have been looking to try to improve the flow of traffic outside of the site, which at times, becomes very difficult for everyone and is regularly resulting in lengthy tailbacks around the site.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This, in turn, causes issues and delays for road users unconnected to the site and regularly contributes to problems on the nearby A40, and as far back as the M5 junction 11.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8847368&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
