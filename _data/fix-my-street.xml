<title>Green or amber traffic light is not working problem, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8847368</link>
<description>I want to draw your attention to an issue we have with regards to the pedestrian crossing outside GCHQ. We have counted several times each cycle and on average the lights were on red for 17 seconds. We hoped that this could be reduced to more like 10-12 seconds. For a number of months, we have been looking to try to improve the flow of traffic outside of the site, which at times, becomes very difficult for everyone and is regularly resulting in lengthy tailbacks around the site.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This, in turn, causes issues and delays for road users unconnected to the site and regularly contributes to problems on the nearby A40, and as far back as the M5 junction 11.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8847368&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No lighting on the drive between Griffith Ave and The Knole, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8847177</link>
<description>I understand that the driveway between Griffith Avenue and the Knole is council owned. Specifically between Griffith Avenue and the fork in the drive (where it splits to The Knole or The Granleys). There is no street lighting here which means it is very dark during the winter months and vulnerable people use the driveway but find it difficult to see.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 5a;5b, Chad Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8847177&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
