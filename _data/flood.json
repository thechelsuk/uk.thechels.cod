We are closely monitoring the situation. Refer to local authority website for road closures. This message will be updated by 1pm on 13th February 2026, or as the situation changes.\n",

It is possible that groundwater at Ladies Mile will rise again next week, through to 22/02/2026, but depends on amounts and intensity of rain, which is uncertain.
