      "message": "High groundwater levels may lead to flooding. \nFlooding is possible from 07/02/2026 because of a wet winter season. \nFlooding could affect Springvale Road in Kings Worthy. In the next 3 days, in Martyr Worthy, Chilland and Easton drainage ditches and culverts will become full and less effective as natural flow paths are restricted. Some properties may be affected as water seeps up through floors. Footpaths near the river will also become inaccessible. At Littleton, cellar flooding is unlikely to commence for around 2 weeks. Today (05/02/2026), up to 30mm of rain is forecast. From Friday (06/02/2026) to Monday (09/02/2026), lighter rain is forecast. Groundwater levels will likely to rise into next week. \nWe are closely monitoring the situation . \nResidents are advised to prepare property resilience measures and ensure that pumps are working where they have been installed . \nThis message will be updated by 6:00PM on 12 February 2026 or as the situation changes.\n\n",
