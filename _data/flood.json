Minor flooding will continue to affect fields, the A29, gardens of properties on Lower Street and Swan Corner, Pulborough and Bridge Cottages, Greatham. The high tide at 11:30 on 20/12/2025 is forecast to be 30cm higher than Friday nights tide. We expect river levels at Houghton Bridge to be slightly higher over Saturday lunch time. There will likely be similar river levels for each high tide through to Monday (22/12/2025). Only a small amount of rain is forecast over the next 5 days. River levels and flood risk should slowly reduce over the next 5 days, however river levels will remain higher than normal until the middle of the week. Consider activating any flood protection products you have and keep them installed in Pulborough, Amberly and Arundel. Our staff are on site at Pulborough with a temporary pump.
