Minor flood impacts affecting fields, roads, and gardens will continue to affect the A29, gardens of properties on Lower Street and Swan Corner, Pulborough and Bridge Cottages, Greatham. Isolated showers are forecast Saturday, and small amounts of rain predicted on Sunday. However, we predict that river levels at Pulborough will keep falling. Although, river levels will not fall far, and with more rain forecast Monday, as well as higher tides, further river rise and flood risk could be possible next week. We are closely monitoring the situation and our pumps in Pulborough are running to help reduce flood risk. Consider activating any flood protection products you may have in Pulborough. This message will be updated by 18:00 01/02/2026.\n",
