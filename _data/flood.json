Residents may experience inundation of septic tanks and sewer systems. Properties may experience flooding in cellars in affected areas. Flooding of roads is expected. Roads may be damaged by floodwater. Any intense rainfall will lead to surface water flooding. We are closely monitoring the situation. If you have a pump, make sure it is working and switched on.
