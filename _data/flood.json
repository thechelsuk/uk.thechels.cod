The next three tides (12:00 21/12/2025, 00:15 22/12/2025, and 12:30 22/12/2025) are forecast to be very similar, and only 10cm lower than Saturday morning's. We therefore expect river levels at Houghton Bridge to peak similar, but a little lower than Saturday through to Tuesday 23/12/2025, when water levels should fall further. Water will be high up banks near Houghton Bridge, Amberley and near St Edmunds Cottage, Houghton. Flood impacts in Arundel are not expected. Only a small amount of rain is forecast Sunday afternoon, then almost no rain next week. River levels and flood risk should slowly reduce over the next five days. However, river levels will remain higher than normal until the middle of next week. Our staff are on site at Pulborough with a temporary pump.
