However, a Flood Alert remains in force for the wider area, so flooding of roads and low lying land is still possible. \nFurther rainfall is forecast but no further flooding is expected.   \nWe will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary.   \nContinue to take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. Never drive through flood water,  just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car.   \n\n",
