      "message": "Groundwater is high, very close to the surface, but now falling. Springs will continue to appear, water will be in fields, small amounts of water will flow down roads, groundwater will affect the ability of the sewage network to operate in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean, and may appear in a small number of basements. Only small amounts of rain are forecast over the five days to 03/03/2026, and it is probable that groundwater at both Chilgrove and East Dean boreholes will continue to slowly fall over the coming week. There is a suggestion that high pressure, settled conditions, and only small amounts of rain could continue in the south east of England through the first half of March 2026. Which would allow groundwater to fall for longer. However, with groundwater so high, groundwater flood impacts are still likely to continue until at least the middle of March. Take care on roads that flood (Chilgrove, West Dean, Singleton, East Dean). Ensure pumps work. We will update this message by 18:00 03/03/2026.\n",
