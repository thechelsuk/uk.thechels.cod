Flooding will continue to affect land and roads, including Burley Road, Brockenhurst throughout today 19/12/2025. The river will be bank full as it flows through Martin’s Road and Balmer Lawn Road and may cause garden flooding at Balmer Lawn Road. In Lymington itself, the river will rise over the next 3 hours, but we do not expect impacts to property. Only a small amount of rain is forecast over the next 5 days. River levels should return to normal during the next 24 hours. We are monitoring rainfall and river levels and will ensure the river is kept free of reported blockages. Stay away from floodwater - it contains hidden dangers such as open manhole covers‚ sewage and chemicals. Avoid driving through watersplash areas in Brockenhurst.
