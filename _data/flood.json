This information is correct as of 4:00pm Wednesday 25th February 2026. The causeway at Sutton Gault has approx 25cm of water on the road. The causeway at Welney has up to 40cm of water on the road. Flood water is receding from the causeway at Earith. Due to the uneven surface of the roads, water may be deeper in places. The Environment Agency are liaising with Norfolk Highways who will decide whether to close the Welney road. For more information about the causeway at Welney, please visit the 'Welney Flood Watch' Facebook group. Please note that the content of this group does not represent the views of the Environment Agency. We are not expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. No rainfall is forecast today. We are monitoring rainfall and river levels. Take care and avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 8:00am Thursday 26th February 2026 or as the situation changes.\n",
