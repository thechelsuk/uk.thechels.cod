Further showers are forecast for the rest of the week but are not expected to cause any further flooding. \n\nOur incident response staff are checking rivers for blockages and clearing debris from weed screens to reduce the risk of flooding. Please avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded and keep up to date with the weather forecast for your area. Never drive through flood water, just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car.

River and drain levels are still high in the lowland areas around Huish Episcopi, Langport, the River Sowy and King's Sedgemoor. The remainder of Sunday will be mainly dry, however rain is forecast tomorrow. This flood alert will remain in force whilst levels remain high. Flooding will affect areas near the Rivers Yeo, Parrett, Kings Sedgemoor Drain and Sowy, with low lying land and roads most affected, including Westover Trading Estate at Langport. We are monitoring rainfall and river levels. We are checking defences, bridges, culverts and screens. We have now commenced pumping and will continue to do so when river levels allow. Take care and avoid driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 1.00PM on 15 December 2025 or as the situation changes.\n",
