Minor flood impacts affecting fields and gardens near Fittleworth Mill will continue through Sunday and Monday. At Lodsbridge near Selham, the river is higher than normal, but slowly falling. Between Liss and Midhurst, river levels have already fallen nearer to a normal level. Light rain is forecast for much of Sunday 07/12/2025. A small river rise is probable in all communities Sunday afternoon, but in all locations other than Fittleworth, river levels will not rise as high as they were on Saturday, and should begin to fall by the early hours of Monday. In Fittleworth, river levels could continue rising until 18:00 on 07/12/2025 and any fall in water level will be slow.
