Previous events suggest impacts may initially affect Old London Road, Patcham and Peacock Lane, Withdean. A small amount of water may appear on roads.

It is possible that groundwater at Ladies Mile will rise again next week, through to 22/02/2026, but depends on amounts and intensity of rain, which is uncertain.
