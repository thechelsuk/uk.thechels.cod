Only isolated showers are forecast today 28/01/2026 and Thursday 29/01/2026. However, the next high tide at 07:30 29/01/2026 is forecast to be 28cm higher. Further flooding impacts are possible during this period. \nWe are checking rivers for blockages and liaising with Southampton City Council on operation of Woodmill. \nActivate any flood protection products you may have . Including defences around the White Swan pub. \nThis message will be updated by 12:59PM on 29 January 2026 or as the situation changes. \n",
