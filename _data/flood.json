However, a Flood Alert remains in force for the wider area, so flooding of roads and low lying land is still possible. \nWeather conditions are expected to improve and no further flooding is expected. Further rain is forecast for Sunday 11 January but this not expected to result in further flooding. \nWe will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary.   \nStay away from floodwater - it contains hidden dangers such as open manhole covers, sewage and chemicals. Never drive through flood water,  just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car.   \n\n",
