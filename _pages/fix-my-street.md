- Is 24 Shelley Road, Cheltenham, Gl51 7DR. I’m sorry I didn’t add it to the most recent email, as it was on the previous complaint I had sent. I assumed someone may have connected the two. This most resent hole, has now developed large pieces of stones, that are being catapulted into the road and onto the pavement. If one hits someone, it could be potentially serious. My son in law picked some up yesterday, as one clipped their car, luckily no damage, as he was slowing down, not speeding as some do. I have already reported this, but I couldn’t add my address to original post, Kind regards Margaret Finch, 1st February :- [8812464](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8812464)
