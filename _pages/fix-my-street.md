- Cromwell Road from 17 down to the corner at 11 seems to be rapidly disintegrating. I am baffled as to why you recently came to repair one pothole but did not bother with the rest of them. There are plenty to chose from. They are deep. One is in the middle of the road. Others nearer the pavement and constantly ejecting large stones. Dangerous to people and property. Your repairs never seem to last very long. I have in the last year had 3 tyres destroyed by Gloucestershire potholes (£750+) and I'm a little fed up of it. I suspect the constant and ludicrously heavy lorries from Mira thundering up and down the street at the crack of dawn do not help. They literally shake my house when they go past. Please get this sorted. Now., 18th February :- [8950082](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8950082)
