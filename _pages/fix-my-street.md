- This is a very poor repair of a pothole. If you study the picture there have been gouges made in the original surface to which the new tarmac should abut. It does not. No decent compaction or edging resulting in rapid deterioration of repair. Tarmac saving and poor effort. The same has happened with a similar repair up the road.
