- Both sides of the pedestrian crossing have poor drainage and often have very large puddles. It is not possible to wait for the crossing within range of the pedestrian sensor without very high risk of being splashed by a passing vehicle. This makes it very difficult to use the crossing. I would imagine the disabled users would find it impossible to cross., 7th February :- [8859579](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8859579)
- Flytipped furniture, 7th February :- [8859507](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8859507)
