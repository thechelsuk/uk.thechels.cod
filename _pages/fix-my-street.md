- As said by fellow user of this road I have lost count over the years that the odd pot hole has been sprayed and poorly filled. Now it has got to the point the road is dangerous and completely unsafe. Huge holes everywhere so uneven it’s basically a fair ground ride going through especially in the dark, if there is one road you want to drive through to knacker your car come to Hayden Lane, this road is not fit for purpose and if you come out and stay a few lines around a whole your just laughable even a child can see how bad It is. South Glos council resurface smaller and less used roads than this so what’s your problem. Close it for a month and repair it properly before someone gets hurt., 24th January :- [8756189](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8756189)
