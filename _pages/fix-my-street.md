- Substandard reinstatement of footway carried out by National Grid contractors approx. 2 weeks ago. Paving slabs have been laid without any bedding or joints. The fines beneath have washed away allowing them to rock, become uneven with upstands creating trip hazards. This also results in water jets through the joints when stood on. It's clear a danger to all pedestrian traffic but especially to those with poor mobility or partial sight. Glos Hways. Network Management will be able to trace the works from recent records and ensure National Grid contractors return urgently to reinstate correctly before an accident occurs; in this instance that may be best executed via a Section 81 Notice., 19th February :- [8955157](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8955157)
