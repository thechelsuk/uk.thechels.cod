- Seriously, 28th February :- [9018985](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018985)
- Flying tipping, 28th February :- [9018974](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018974)
- There has been a no entry sign at the top of the road for well over a year but we are still getting people coming in the no entry part of the road and I fear we are going to have a nasty accident one day, I have reported this previously, when stopping vehicles and telling them they have come through a no entry they tell me they didn't see any signs, they are too small and not facing the correct way for oncoming traffic to see them, 28th February :- [9018939](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018939)
- Massive pot holes that need re surfacing immediately, 28th February :- [9018905](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018905)

- 4" deep and large..in road and now impacting on our drive and many cars hitting it, 28th February :- [9018291](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018291)
- Loose metal drain cover in road rocks & bangs each time a vehicle passes over it. The volume has increased & I think that the range of movement has increased to match, there may come a point when it fails. I can hear it clearly day & night at the end of Chatsworth Drive, those living closer must really be disturbed by the constant noise. Also, as the movement increases the likelihood that it will become more of a hazard, damage car tyres or unseating cyclists becomes more likely., 28th February :- [9018264](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018264)
- Very deep pothole on crest of hill up to cooper's hill, 28th February :- [9018224](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018224)

- Enormous flatscreen TV flight tipped Junction Sussex Avenue and Rowanfield Road, 28th February :- [9018120](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018120)
- There is a pothole more than 10 inches deep on Whittington Road that caused my car tyre to burst. The hole is extremely large and deep — the worst I have ever seen. Because cars are parked on both sides of the road, it is impossible to avoid driving through it. As a result, three tyres have burst due to this pothole. This is a serious safety hazard and needs urgent repair., 28th February :- [9018102](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9018102)
