- Warning no longer in force: River Wye in Gloucestershire
- There is no longer a threat of flooding, though standing water and debris may still remain. 
Weather conditions are expected to improve and no further flooding is expected. This alert is being removed but rainfall throughout Monday is likely to require a re-issuing of the alert on Tuesday morning 
We will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary.  
Continue to take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. Never drive through flood water,  just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car.
