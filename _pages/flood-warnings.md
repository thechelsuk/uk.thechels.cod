Further showers are forecast for the rest of the week but are not expected to cause any further flooding. 

Our incident response staff are checking rivers for blockages and clearing debris from weed screens to reduce the risk of flooding. Please avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded and keep up to date with the weather forecast for your area. Never drive through flood water, just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car. Don't put yourself or others at risk.
