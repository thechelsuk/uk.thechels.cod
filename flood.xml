      <title>Flood alert: Upper Bristol Avon area</title>
      <description>River levels are falling. Flooding is still expected to affect locations near the Bristol Avon, Tetbury Avon, Sherston Avon, Dauntsey Brook, with low lying land and roads expected to be most affected, particularly around low lying areas in Tetbury, Badminton, Brook End at Luckington, Corsham, Lacock and the road at Reybridge. Further showers are forecast for the rest of the week but are not expected to cause any further flooding. 

Our incident response staff are checking rivers for blockages and clearing debris from weed screens to reduce the risk of flooding. Please avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded and keep up to date with the weather forecast for your area. Never drive through flood water, just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car. Don't put yourself or others at risk.
