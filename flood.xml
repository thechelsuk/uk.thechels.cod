      <title>Warning no longer in force: Severn Estuary at Severn Beach</title>

The previous tide of concern has now passed,  the weather is more settled and no flooding is expected.   
We will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary.   
Never drive through flood water,  just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car. Continue to take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.
