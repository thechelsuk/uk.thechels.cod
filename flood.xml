      <title>Flood alert: River Churn and its tributaries</title>
      <description>The flood risk remains.

Flooding of low lying land and roads is expected to continue. River levels are high, but falling very slowly, along the River Churn, near Cerney Wick. The weather forecast is for showers to pass through the area on Friday morning and then to be mostly dry for the next few days. We expect river levels to remain high but to continue to fall slowly over the coming days.

We are closely monitoring the situation. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses. Go to River levels online for updates on current river levels.
